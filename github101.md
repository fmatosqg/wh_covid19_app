# Get started

## What is Github?
Github is a good place where developers write source code (the magic bits that power all sorts of apps) with each other so they can collaborate and exchange information.

## Do I need an account?
There are many ways to participate in this project. Some ways need you to log into github, some don't.

- If you want to report a problem and follow up on it, the best way would be to create an `issue` (more below)
- If you want to download the app you do NOT need a github account, go to ? / ?
